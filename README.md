Step-by-Step Guide to Changing Your IP Address on iPhone, Android, Windows, and Mac.

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) serves as a unique identifier for your device on a network, enabling communication between devices. It can reveal your geographical location and internet activity. Changing your IP address can help mask your online identity, bypass content restrictions in certain regions, and assist in network troubleshooting.

# Methods to Change Your IP Address
There are various methods to change your IP address depending on your device and requirements. Restarting your router often results in a new IP from your ISP. Manually configuring the IP on Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android allows you to set a specific address. For privacy and geo-restriction purposes, using a VPN or proxy server will mask your real IP with one from their servers. These methods are common and widely used on all platforms, including phones and computers.

# Quick IP Address Changer – VPN
Select a VPN Service: Opt for reputable VPN services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or CyberGhost.
Install the VPN App: Download and install the VPN application on your device.
Connect to a Server: Open the app, choose a server in your desired location, and connect.
Verify IP Change: Check your new IP address by searching “What is my IP” in a web browser.

# Popular IP Address Changer – Proxy
Choose a Proxy Service: Options include HideMyAss, ProxySite, or a paid service like OkeyProxy. It offers 1GB test free [proxy trial](https://www.okeyproxy.com/en) for one day using and residential proxies only for $3/GB for 1 month using.
Configure Proxy Settings:
Windows: Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy. Enter the proxy server’s address and port.
macOS: Go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Proxies. Enter the proxy server’s details.
Mobile Devices: Go to Wi-Fi settings, select your network, and configure the proxy settings.
All Platforms: Install a proxy client such as Clash, V2RayNG, or Shadowrocket. Open it and configure a new server with the proxy server’s details.
Verify IP Change: Use a service like IPVibe to confirm if your IP address has changed.

# Changing IP Address Without VPN/Proxy
